            My name is Sabrina, and I've been working as a programmer since 2017. I began my career as a back-end
            developer specializing in Java, but I soon discovered my passion for front-end development. Since making the
            switch, I've been dedicated to creating engaging and intuitive user interfaces. You can explore my full
            journey here

            As you can see this site is build as micro-fronend and is very robust for the proposition, but is how I
            found to show almost everything that I learned in my career

        <S.Description>
          When I&apos;m not taming JavaScript or styling components, you‚Äôll find me buzzing around my favorite things:
          Bees üêù (they&apos;re nature&apos;s overachievers, and I relate!). Stardew Valley üéÆ (because life needs more
          cozy farming vibes). Anything that brings warmth and a touch of calm to life. Explore my projects to see how I
          transform ideas into interactive, user-friendly experiences. Whether it‚Äôs developing seamless APIs, responsive
          designs, or scaling front-end systems, I‚Äôm all about creating code that's as clean and cozy as a cup of hot
          tea. Let‚Äôs make something amazing together! üíõ{" "}
